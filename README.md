# pdf_duplex

I accidentally bought a printer that prints only single sided and not duplex, so
I wrote a program that will split a pdf into two files, one with odd pages and
another with even.

Then I print only the odd pages first, and re-insert the pages to print the even
sides on the same sheets of paper.

The code uses (pypdf)[https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf] in the simplest possible
way.

Enjoy!
